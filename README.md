# These Crazy Walls Clone in Xamarin.Forms

In celebration of Xamarin's [recent acquisition](https://blog.xamarin.com/a-xamarin-microsoft-future/?utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=blog&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=xamarin-joins-microsoft&utm_term=), here you will find my open source version of [These Crazy Walls Clone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/these-crazy-walls/id1033014013?mt=8) in Xamarin.Forms and CocosSharp.

---
This solution contains an iOS and Android project which combines CocosSharp with Xamarin Forms. All code (aside from initial template code) is contained in a PCL.

This demo is built against CocosSharp 1.7.1.
